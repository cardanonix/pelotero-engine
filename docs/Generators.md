# ⚾ Generators ⚾
a suite of functions for generating randomized rankings utilizing Haskell's strong type system and functional programming paradigms to offer robust utilities for ensuring roster compliance with league rules, detecting discrepancies, and performing lineup validations. Below is a summary of each function and its purpose:

# Functions
- extractNameFromPath: Extracts the filename from a given file path, useful for processing or displaying file names without their directory paths.

- processConfigResults: Takes a configuration and a list of files (with their contents parsed as team rosters), testing each lineup against the configuration rules and reporting the results.
