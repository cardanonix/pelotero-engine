# Haskell Code Summary: Baseball_V5

This Haskell code defines a set of data types and functions for managing baseball rosters, players, and their statistics.

## Data Types

### Identities

-   `Id`: A generic newtype wrapper for identifiers, parametrized by a type variable.
-   `BallparkId`, `MLBPlayerId`, `TeamId`: Type aliases for identifiers of ballparks, players, and teams, respectively.

### Enums

-   `League`: AmericanLeague or NationalLeague.
-   `Division`: East, Central, or West.
-   `Position`: Pitcher, Reliever, DH, Catcher, FirstBase, SecondBase, ThirdBase, Shortstop, or Outfield.

### Records

-   `Ballpark`: Contains an identifier and a name.
-   `MLBTeam`: Contains an identifier, name, home park ID, league, division, abbreviation, a list of tuples with player IDs and their positions, and a `RosterCount`.
-   `PositionCount`: Contains the minimum and maximum count for a position.
-   `RosterCount`: Contains a map of positions and their respective position counts.
-   `MLBPlayer`: Contains an identifier, first name, last name, team ID, list of positions, injured list status, and countStats flag.
-   `Stats`: Contains a player ID and a stat type.
-   `StatType`: A sum type with two alternatives: `BattingStat BattingStats` or `PitchingStat PitchingStats`.
-   `BattingStats`: Contains various batting statistics.
-   `PitchingStats`: Contains various pitching statistics.

## Constants

-   `typicalRosterCount`: A typical `RosterCount` for a team, with preset position counts.

## Nulls

2.  `emptyStats`: An empty stats record.
3.  `emptyBattingStats`: Empty batting statistics.
4.  `emptyPitchingStats`: Empty pitching statistics.
5.  `nullPlayer`: A null MLB player.
6.  `nullMLBPlayerId`: A null MLB player identifier.

## Functions

1.  `validRoster`: Checks if a roster is valid based on position counts and roster counts.
2.  `countPositions`: Counts the number of players for each position in a list of players.
3.  `validateRoster`: Validates a roster based on player positions and roster count.
4.  `batting`: Extracts batting stats from a Stats record.
5.  `pitching`: Extracts pitching stats from a Stats record.
6.  `battingStatValues`: Extracts batting stat values from a BattingStats record.
7.  `pitchingStatValues`: Extracts pitching stat values from a PitchingStats record.
