make a bash script that looks at the json files in a folder and creates a composite summed json file of all of them


scrapedData/2023_03_30/2023_03_30_gameIds.txt which is a list of game ids with nothing else:
that looks like this
``
718767
718768
718769
718770
718772
718773
718774
718775
718776
718777
718778
718779
718780
718781
718782
``
and uses those game id's to scrape json files which are named like this: scrapedData/2023_03_30/718767_FINAL.json
